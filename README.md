# Flower-Whisperer

## IoT project using Arduino and some sensors...
Will have a mobile app (Android and iOS) for users to view all the health info of their plants, and it will tell the user specifically what to do to take care of their favorite plants.


I'm following the [Sensor-App-Cloud](IoT-Architecture.jpeg) architecture to build this IoT project.
